Focusing on PD among all other neurological diseases. 
Mention the symptoms.
Provide 5 papers using vocal characteristics.
UPDRS Scaling discussing the 5 stages of PD.
People involved in the diagnosis: speech therapist, occupational therapist, neurologist, physiotherapist.

Since there are many features in the dataset and we cannot avoid any of them, 
i will use a Deep Learning framework, since it perform the feature extraction itself.
Will be using a RNN

will be using the keras library to generate the dense layer

to optimize and incraese the efficacy, i will be using the regurlarization techniques
also to avoid overfitting, we will be using the dropout concept

types of activation function

at every node, processing will happen using an activation function.

cost function or loss function

evaluation metrics accuracy, precision and recall

hyperparameter tuning: no of hidden layers, no of nodes, dropout, regularization technique, optimizer, loss function and metrics
